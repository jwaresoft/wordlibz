He was born at Hanover Township, New Jersey, and graduated at Middlebury College in 1827.  After teaching for some years he studied theology and began to preach in 1849.  He served in a number of widely different positions in his lifetime.  The foremost of them were:  pastor at Cornwall, Vermont and East Hampton, Long Island; professor of languages in Washington College, Pennsylvania (1853); and president of St. Louis University in 1859.  In 1862 he became secretary of the New York Prison Association, and of the National Prison Association in 1870.  In 1871–72 he organized in London the first international congress on prison discipline.\nDr. Enoch Cobb Wines of the faculty of the Philadelphia Central High School from 1838 to 1841 became the  first teacher of Ethics in an American High School in 1839.",

It is sometimes prescribed to sex offenders as a condition of their parole, as an alternative to anti-androgen drugs such as cyproterone acetate.\nBenperidol was discovered by Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1961 and has been marketed since 1966. It is mainly used in Germany, but it is also available in Belgium, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.",

      "extract": "In an isotonic contraction, tension remains the same, whilst the muscle's length changes. Isotonic contractions differ from isokinetic contractions in that in isokinetic contractions the muscle speed remains constant.  While superficially identical, as the muscle's force changes via the length-tension relationship during a contraction, an isotonic contraction will keep force constant while velocity changes, but an isokinetic contraction will keep velocity constant while force changes.  A near isotonic contraction is known as Auxotonic contraction.\nThere are two types of isotonic contractions: (1) concentric and (2) eccentric. In a concentric contraction, the muscle tension rises to meet the resistance, then remains the same as the muscle shortens.  In eccentric, the muscle lengthens due to the resistance being greater than the force the muscle is producing.",

Tom had four sons, Patrick, villainous Darryl (Mark Ferguson), Damien (Mark Ferguson) and original teenage heart throb Stuart (Martin Henderson). The character's yearlong run saw the character participate in numerous storylines, including teenage pregnancy, rape, drug abuse, illness and a storyline that saw Tom become a missing person.\nThe storyline that saw Tom go missing became hugely popular, so much so that Tom was eventually brought back to finish off the storyline.

      "extract": "Pokémon, known in Japan as Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā), is a Japanese anime television series produced by animation studio OLM for TV Tokyo. It is adapted from the Pokémon video game series published by Nintendo. The series originally follows the Pokémon trainer and aspiring Pokémon master Ash Ketchum and his adventures with his electric mouse-like partner Pikachu (voiced by Ikue Ōtani), and a varying group of friends. However, by the 26th season, a new cast is featured, with new protagonists Liko and Roy.\nThe division between seasons of Pokémon is based on the Japanese version openings of each episode and reflect the actual production season. The English episode numbers are based on their final airing either in syndication, on The WB, Cartoon Network, Disney XD or Netflix. Subsequent episodes of the English version follow the original Japanese order, except where banned episodes are shown.",
