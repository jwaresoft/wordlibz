      "extract": "Paul David Heaton (born 9 May 1962) is an English singer-songwriter. He was the lead singer and main lyricist of The Housemartins, who had commercial success in the UK and other European countries between 1985 and 1988 with several singles including \"Happy Hour\" and the UK number one single \"Caravan of Love\" in 1986, before the band disbanded in 1988. Heaton then formed The Beautiful South with The Housemartins' drummer Dave Hemingway in 1988, and the band's debut single (Song for Whoever) and debut album (Welcome to the Beautiful South) were released in 1989 to commercial success. They had a series of hits throughout the 1990s, including the number-one single \"A Little Time\". They disbanded in 2007. He subsequently pursued a solo career, which produced three albums, and in 2014 he released What Have We Become?, a collaboration with former Beautiful South vocalist Jacqui Abbott. As of 2022, he has recorded four more albums with her: Wisdom, Laughter and Lines in 2015, Crooked Calypso in 2017, Manchester Calling in 2020 and N.K-Pop in 2022. Heaton performed at Glastonbury on 28th June 2024 with backing singer Rianne Downey.  Earlier in June, it was announced on Heaton's homepage and on Heaton's official account on Twitter (@PaulHeatonSolo) that a new album, \"The Mighty Several\"  (produced by Ian Broudie) will be released on Friday 11 October 2024.\nBritish newspaper The Guardian has described Heaton as \"one of our finest songwriters: his music reveals an exuberant ear for melody, his lyrics a keen eye and a brilliant wit\".",

      "extract": "The Vortex (Spanish: La Vorágine) is a novel written in 1924 by the Colombian author José Eustasio Rivera. It is set in at least three different bioregions of Colombia during the rubber boom. This novel narrates the adventures of Arturo Cova, a hot-headed proud chauvinist and his lover Alicia, as they elope from Bogotá, through the eastern plains and later, escaping from criminal misgivings, through the amazon rainforest of Colombia.\nIn this way Rivera is able to describe the magic of these regions, with their rich biodiversity, and the lifestyle of the inhabitants. However, one of the main objectives of the novel is to reveal the appalling conditions that workers in the rubber factories experience. La Vorágine also introduces the reader to the tremendous hardship of enduring the overwhelming and adverse environment of the rainforest, as the protagonists (Arturo Cova and Alicia) get lost and are unable to be found. As the book says: ¡Los devoró la selva! (literally, \"The jungle devoured them!\").\nThe novel is written in an elegant and refined prose, full of metaphors and prosaic poetry, that shows the beauty and exoticism of the virgin rainforest. \nThe book focuses on two rubber collecting regions, one on the border near Venezuela, during Tomás Funes reign of terror.",

      "extract": "The Supermarine S.6B is a British racing seaplane developed by R.J. Mitchell for the Supermarine company to take part in the Schneider Trophy competition of 1931. The S.6B marked the culmination of Mitchell's quest to \"perfect the design of the racing seaplane\" and represented the cutting edge of aerodynamic technology for the era.\nThe S.6B was last in a line of racing seaplanes to be developed by Supermarine, following the S.4, S.5 and the S.6. Despite these predecessors having   previously won the Schneider Trophy competition twice, the development of the S.6B was hampered by wavering government support, which was first promised then withdrawn, and then given once more after a high-profile public campaign encouraged by Lord Rothermere and backed by a substantial donation by Lady Houston. Once government backing had been secured, there were only nine months before the race, so Mitchell's only realistic option was to refine the existing S.6, rather than attempting a new design.\nThe principal  differences between the S.6 and the S.6B were the increased power of the Rolls-Royce R engine and redesigned floats:  minor aerodynamic refinements typically aimed at drag reduction were also made. A pair of S.6Bs, serials S1595 and S1596, were built for the competition. Flown by members of RAF High Speed Flight, the type competed successfully, winning the Schneider Trophy for Britain. Shortly after the race, S.6B S1596, flown by Flt Lt. George Stainforth, broke the world air speed record, attaining a peak speed of 407.5 mph (655.67 km/h).",

It was at this spot that he gave away his protective armor to Indra, the Godfather of Arjuna, Karna's arch-enemy. It is surmised that the city of Karnal derives its name from Karna-Taal, which translates to Karna Lake.

The ships are also employed in other missions as the search and rescue, maritime pollution control and force protection of combatant ships in confined waters.\nFive ships were built, these being named after constellations.\nIn 2000, an upgraded version of the Argos class entered service in the Portuguese Navy. This new version was initially referred as the Argos (2nd series) class, but it is now usually referred to as the Centauro class.\nIt is to note, that from 1963 to 1975, the Portuguese Navy employed a class of large patrol boats that was also designated Argos class.",
